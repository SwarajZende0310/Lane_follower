# Lane Following Robot with Junction Management
This repository contains the code and resources for a four-wheeled differential drive robot equipped with a camera for lane following and junction management. This robot is designed to autonomously navigate lanes while effectively managing intersections or junctions.

## Features
- __Lane Following__: Utilizes computer vision algorithms to detect and follow lanes on the road.
- __Junction Management__: Implements strategies to safely navigate intersections or junctions.
- __Differential Drive__: Control system for a four-wheeled differential drive robot.
- __Camera Integration__: Utilizes a camera for perception and environment understanding.
- __OpenCV Integration__: Leveraging OpenCV for image processing and computer vision tasks.
- __Modular Design__: Codebase structured in a modular way for easy understanding and modification.
- __Documentation__: Detailed documentation for understanding code components and system architecture.
